# Hi, I'm Ine! 👋

Code enthusiast, passionate designer , and dog lover. 🎨💻🐾

## About Me

I'm on a mission to make everything beautiful and user-friendly. Whether it's designing, painting, redecorating, or creating prototypes in Figma, I find joy in transforming ideas into visually pleasing experiences. My mind constantly seeks improvements, and I can't help but envision better design flows for non-user-friendly platforms.

What turned me into a developer? The desire to bring designs to life and explore the possibilities of different solutions. I love the instant results of coding, where each line contributes to making ideas tangible. Now, as I delve into TypeScript and JavaScript, my goal is for the best solutions to pop into my mind as lines of code – just like those Tailwind parameters.

I'm not just a perfectionist; I define the best way as the most effective way. I'm constantly challenging myself, researching alternative solutions, and striving to be the best developer I can be. My approach? Stop at "good enough" when necessary and ensure what I'm doing is the absolute best.

## When I'm Not Coding⚡

In my spare time, you'll find me indulging in my other passion: dogs. My furry companion is my everything, and I can never get enough of those wagging tails. Whether it's spending time with my pup or dreaming about having ten more, dogs are an integral part of my happiness.
